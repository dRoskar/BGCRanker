BGCRanker
=========

A tool used for ranking members of a board gaming club.

Why?
====

I'm running a boardgame club, where a bunch of people come together to play tabletop games once a week. One day I came upon this idea, that I could record people's victories and then have them level up and achieve ranks.
Example:
Steve plays the game Arkham Horror for the first time. For participating he gets his first rank and is now level 1 in Arkham Horror. Being level 1, his rank is now "The Bystander" or something simialrly of little importance. After a couple of months, Steve has 8 victories in Arkham Horror. He is now level 4, Rank: "The Scientist".

Meanwhile, steve is also a regular player of the game Love Letter, where he has achieved level 18 - "The Casanova".


What exactly does the software do?
==================================

The software helps you enter victories for you players and automatically calculates what level they are, and what rank this corresponds to. 

The software does not come up with the names for your ranks. You do this yourself. This program will let you choose how many levels your players can achieve in each game and what rank each level corresponds to.

Doing this, the program also keeps all of the information in human-readable text files.
